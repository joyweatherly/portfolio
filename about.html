        		<p>Hello! My name is Joy Weatherly and I was born and raised in Georgia. Growing up, I have always been more artistic than not. In class I was always doodling and I loved every art class that I took growing up.</p>

                <p>However, when I went off to college, I chose to go into a Psychology major at the University of Georgia as I felt that I would have a more secure job in that area. I quickly grew tired of it and started thinking about changing my major. At this time I had also built my first PC and wanted to start working with computers in some way.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>After my Sophmore year, I switched to a Computer Science major but quickly dicovered that was not for me when I started failing classes for the first time in my life.</p>
                <p>Because I was failing, I panicked and dropped out of school for a semester while I thought about what I wanted to do with my life. I really wanted to incorporate art and design into my major and combine those two with a bit of CS.</p>
                <p>This lead to me applying and getting accepted to Kennesaw State University and changing my major to Interaction Design. I have been loving my new major and created this website as part of my classes in this major.</p>
